This is rather simple web app that checks if given website was built with Liferay!

While useful it's more of a PoC and experimental project to help the author learn and play with
 - [WeDeploy](http://wedeploy.com)
 - [WebComponents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Components) and [Polymer](https://www.polymer-project.org/1.0/)
 - [OSGi enRoute](http://enroute.osgi.org/) style web applications deployment in [WeDeploy](http://wedeploy.com)
